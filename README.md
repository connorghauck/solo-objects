# EG - Evil Geniuses

##### I chose this team because they're one of my favorite "esports" teams in
##### the world, and they've represented the USA/Canada for over 16 years in a
##### heavily Eastern hemisphere dominated "esport".


"Evil Geniuses are a DotA 2 team created in 1999 consisting of the players Suma1L, Arteezy, UNiVeRSE, zai, and Cr1t-.
They have won 6 major tournaments, totalling in over $13,000,000, including the 2015 DotA 2 International. Which alone netted them $6,600,000."
